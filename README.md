# A Robot To Follow People
This repository is dedicated to the master thesis research project of **Stefano Leonardi** at the **University of Trento** for the **Dolomiti Robotics** group.

The goal of this code is to allow a robot equipped with a Camera to detect, identify and track a person in a real-time video.
Then with the use of a lidar sensor follow it across time through a real environment.

> The code works with some DNN (Deep Neural Network) pre-trained models.
